# Learning Objectives üìñ
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), **without the help of Google**:
## Generalüßµ
* Learn how to use redis for basic operations
* Learn how to use redis as a simple cache

# Requirements üèõÔ∏è
* All of your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
* All of your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
* Your code should use the `pycodestyle style` (version 2.5)
* All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions and methods should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it‚Äôs a real sentence explaining what‚Äôs the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.

# Install Redis on Ubuntu 18.04 üíº
```groovy
$ sudo apt-get -y install redis-server
$ pip3 install redis
$ sed -i "s/bind .*/bind 127.0.0.1/g" /etc/redis/redis.conf
```

# Use Redis in a container
Redis server is stopped by default - when you are starting a container, you should start it with: `service redis-server start`

## Troubleshooting
1. **Check if Redis is Running:**

Ensure that the Redis server is running on your machine. You can check this by running:

```groovy
redis-server
```
If it's not running, start it with:

```groovy
redis-server
```

2. **Verify Redis Configuration:**

Open your Redis configuration file, typically located at `/etc/redis/redis.conf`. Check if it's configured to bind to `localhost`. The line should look like this:

```groovy
bind 127.0.0.1
```
If it's commented out (`#` at the beginning of the line), uncomment it and restart Redis.

3. **Check for Other Processes Using Port 6379:**

It's possible that another process is using the same port. You can check this using the following command:

```groovy
sudo lsof -i :6379
```
If another process is using the port, you might need to stop that process or configure Redis to use a different port.

4. **Check Network Configuration:**

Ensure that there are no network issues preventing the connection. The error suggests that there might be an issue with the network configuration.

5. **Restart Redis:**

After making changes to the Redis configuration, restart the Redis server:

```groovy
sudo service redis-server restart
```
6. **Check Firewall Settings:**

If you have a firewall enabled, ensure that it allows connections to port 6379.
